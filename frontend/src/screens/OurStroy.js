              We disrupt traditional supply chains by building farms on major
              distribution routes and near population centers. We defy
              traditional growing seasons by enabling local farming at
              commercial scale all-year round. We set a new standard for
              traceability by managing our greens from seed to package. And we
              do it all while using 95% less water than field farmed-food and
              with yields 390 times higher per square foot annually.

              Our passion is great tasting food and sharing our harvest with the
              world. We recently began growing at our ninth farm — the world’s
              largest indoor vertical farm and our new global headquarters in
              Newark, NJ (pictured). There has been tremendous demand for our
              locally grown, delicious, produce, and we have farms in
              development in multiple US states and on four continents. There
              has never been a greater need for safe, dependable, nutritious
              food, and we are scaling quickly to transform agriculture around
              the world.
